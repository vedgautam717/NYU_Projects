# Deep Learning Intrusion Detection System

## Abstract

We propose a novel approach for network intrusion detection using Bidirectional GANs (Bi-GANs), which leverage transfer learning from the discriminator to the generator. This enables the generator to produce realistic synthetic samples that match the features of intrusion data, which are different from image data in terms of structure, dimensionality, and size. Our method trains the generator and the discriminator separately until a certain loss criterion is met, improving the efficiency and performance of both components. We also introduce a one-class classifier based on the encoderâ€“discriminator pair, which simplifies the intrusion detection process by avoiding the use of anomaly scores or thresholds.
